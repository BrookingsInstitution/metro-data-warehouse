# BEA modifications =======================================================
# BEA counties and county equivalents are identified by five-digit Federal
# Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes. The first two digits are the
# FIPS state code and the last three digits are the county code within the
# state. BEA has created modified FIPS codes for the following conditions:
#
# Kalawao County, Hawaii is combined with Maui County and combined area is
# designated 15901.
#
# The independent cities of Virginia with populations of less than 100,000 have
# been combined with an adjacent county and given codes beginning with 51901. In
# the name of the combined area, the county name appears first and is followed
# by the city name(s).
#
# Menominee County, Wisconsin is combined with Shawano County for 1969â€“1988 as
# 55901. Separate estimates for Menominee and Shawano Counties begin in 1989.
